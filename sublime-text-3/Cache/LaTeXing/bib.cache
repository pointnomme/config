The data usually come in the form of a list of metabolites whose concentrations significantly changed under some conditions, and are thus not easy to interpret without being able to precisely visualize how such metabolites are interconnected.Results:â€ƒWe present a method that enables to organize the data from any metabolomics experiment into metabolic stories. Each story corresponds to a possible scenario explaining the flow of matter between the metabolites of interest. These scenarios may then be ranked in different ways depending on which interpretation one wishes to emphasize for the causal link between two affected metabolites: enzyme activation, enzyme inhibition or domino effect on the concentration changes of substrates and products. Equally probable stories under any selected ranking scheme can be further grouped into a single anthology that summarizes, in a unique subnetwork, all equivalently plausible alternative stories. An anthology is simply a union of such stories. We detail an application of the method to the response of yeast to cadmium exposure. We use this system as a proof of concept for our method, and we show that we are able to find a story that reproduces very well the current knowledge about the yeast response to cadmium. We further show that this response is mostly based on enzyme activation. We also provide a framework for exploring the alternative pathways or side effects this local response is expected to have in the rest of the network. We discuss several interpretations for the changes we see, and we suggest hypotheses that could in principle be experimentally tested. Noticeably, our method requires simple input data and could be used in a wide variety of applications.Availability and implementation:â€ƒThe code for the method presented in this article is available at http://gobbolino.gforge.inria.fr.Contact:â€ƒpvmilreu@gmail.com; vincent.lacroix@univ-lyon1.fr; marie-france.sagot@inria.frSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "author": "Milreu, Paulo Vieira and Klein, Cecilia Coimbra and Cottret, Ludovic and AcuÃ±a, Vicente and BirmelÃ©, Etienne and Borassi, Michele and Junot, Christophe and Marchetti-Spaccamela, Alberto and Marino, Andrea and Stougie, Leen and Jourdan, Fabien and Crescenzi, Pierluigi and Lacroix, Vincent and Sagot, Marie-France", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/btt597", "eprint": "http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/1/61.full.pdf+html", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "number": "1", "pages": "61-70", "title": "Telling metabolic stories to explore metabolomics data: a case study on the yeast response to cadmium exposure", "url": "http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/1/61.abstract", "volume": "30", "year": "2014"}, "key": "1", "type": "Article"}, {"fields": {"author": "Vicente AcuÃ±a and Etienne BirmelÃ© and Ludovic Cottret and Pierluigi Crescenzi and Fabien Jourdan and Vincent Lacroix and Alberto Marchetti-Spaccamela and Andrea Marino and Paulo Vieira Milreu and Marie-France Sagot and Leen Stougie", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tcs.2012.07.023", "issn": "0304-3975", "journal": "Theoretical Computer Science ", "keywords": "Story arc set ", "number": "0", "pages": "1 - 9", "title": "Telling stories: Enumerating maximal directed acyclic graphs with a constrained set of sources and targets ", "url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397512007207", "volume": "457", "year": "2012"}, "key": "2", "type": "Article"}, {"fields": {"abstract": "Motivation: In the context of studying whole metabolic networks and their interaction with the environment, the following question arises: given a set of target metabolites T and a set of possible external source metabolites , which are the minimal subsets of  that are able to produce all the metabolites in T. Such subsets are called the minimal precursor sets of T. The problem is then whether we can enumerate all of them efficiently.Results: We propose a new characterization of precursor sets as the inputs of reaction sets called factories and an efficient algorithm to decide if a set of sources is precursor set of T. We show proofs of hardness for the problems of finding a precursor set of minimum size and of enumerating all minimal precursor sets T. We propose two new algorithms which, despite the hardness of the enumeration problem, allow to enumerate all minimal precursor sets in networks with up to 1000 reactions.Availability: Source code and datasets used in our benchmarks are freely available for download at http://sites.google.com/site/pitufosoftware/download.Contact: vicente77@gmail.com, pvmilreu@gmail.com or marie-france.sagot@inria.fr", "author": "AcuÃ±a, Vicente and Milreu, Paulo Vieira and Cottret, Ludovic and Marchetti-Spaccamela, Alberto and Stougie, Leen and Sagot, Marie-France", "doi": "10.1093/bioinformatics/bts423", "eprint": "http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/19/2474.full.pdf+html", "journal": "Bioinformatics", "number": "19", "pages": "2474-2483", "title": "Algorithms and complexity of enumerating minimal precursor sets in genome-wide metabolic networks", "url": "http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/19/2474.abstract", "volume": "28", "year": "2012"}, "key": "3", "type": "Article"}, {"fields": {"author": "Cottret, Ludovic and Vieira Milreu, Paulo and AcuÃ±a, Vicente and Marchetti-Spaccamela, Alberto and Viduani Martinez, FÃ¡bio and Sagot, Marie-France and Stougie, Leen", "booktitle": "Algorithms in Bioinformatics", "doi": "10.1007/978-3-540-87361-7_20", "editor": "Crandall, KeithA. and Lagergren, Jens", "isbn": "978-3-540-87360-0", "language": "English", "pages": "233-244", "publisher": "Springer Berlin Heidelberg", "series": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "title": "Enumerating Precursor Sets of Target Metabolites in a Metabolic Network", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-87361-7_20", "volume": "5251", "year": "2008"}, "key": "4", "type": "Article"}]}, "/home/arnaud/Dropbox/postdoc/friendly_partition/bib.bib": {"cites": [{"fields": {"author": "Cristina Bazgan and Zsolt Tuza and Daniel Vanderpooten", "doi": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.10.005", "issn": "0166-218X", "journal": "Discrete Applied Mathematics ", "keywords": "Vertex degree ", "number": "8", "pages": "979 - 988", "title": "Efficient algorithms for decomposing graphs under degree constraints ", "url": "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166218X06004550", "volume": "155", "year": "2007"}, "key": "Bazgan07", "type": "Article"}, {"fields": {"author": "Kaneko, Atsushi", "doi": "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0118(199801)27:1<7::AID-JGT2>3.0.CO;2-U", "issn": "1097-0118", "journal": "Journal of Graph Theory", "keywords": "graph, degree, decomposition, triangle-free", "number": "1", "pages": "7--9", "publisher": "Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company", "title": "On decomposition of triangle-free graphs under degree constraints", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0118(199801)27:1<7::AID-JGT2>3.0.CO;2-U", "volume": "27", "year": "1998"}, "key": "Kaneko98", "type": "Article"}, {"fields": {"author": "Diwan, Ajit A.", "doi": "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0118(200004)33:4<237::AID-JGT4>3.0.CO;2-A", "issn": "1097-0118", "journal": "Journal of Graph Theory", "keywords": "graph, decomposition, degree, girth", "number": "4", "pages": "237--239", "publisher": "John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "title": "Decomposing graphs with girth at least five under degree constraints", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0118(200004)33:4<237::AID-JGT4>3.0.CO;2-A", "volume": "33", "year": "2000"}, "key": "Diwan00", "type": "Article"}, {"fields": {"author": "Stiebitz, Michael", "doi": "10.1002/(SICI)1097-0118(199611)23:3<321::AID-JGT12>3.0.CO;2-H", "issn": "1097-0118", "journal": "Journal of Graph Theory", "number": "3", "pages": "321--324", "publisher": "Wiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Company", "title": "Decomposing graphs under degree constraints", "url": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0118(199611)23:3<321::AID-JGT12>3.0.CO;2-H", "volume": "23", "year": "1996"}, "key": "Stiebitz96", "type": "Article"}]}}, "rtime": "18.03.2015T10:34:41"}
